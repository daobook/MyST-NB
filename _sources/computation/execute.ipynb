    "```python\n",
    "nb_execution_mode = \"cache\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, when a page is executed, its outputs will be stored in a local database.\n",
    "This allows you to be sure that the outputs in your documentation are up-to-date, while saving time avoiding unnecessary re-execution.\n",
    "It also allows you to store your `.ipynb` files (or their `.md` equivalent) in your `git` repository *without their outputs*, but still leverage a cache to save time when building your site.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{tip}\n",
    "You should only use this option when notebooks have deterministic execution outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You use the same environment to run them (e.g. the same installed packages)\n",
    "- They run no non-deterministic code (e.g. random numbers)\n",
    "- They do not depend on external resources (e.g. files or network connections) that change over time\n",

    "\n",
    "When you re-build your site, the following will happen:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Notebooks that have not seen changes to their **code cells** or **metadata** since the last build will not be re-executed.\n",
    "  Instead, their outputs will be pulled from the cache and inserted into your site.\n",
    "- Notebooks that **have any change to their code cells** will be re-executed, and the cache will be updated with the new outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the cache will be placed in the parent of your build folder.\n",
    "Generally, this is in `_build/.jupyter_cache`, and it will also be specified in the build log, e.g.\n",

    "```\n",
    "Using jupyter-cache at: ./docs/_build/.jupyter_cache\n",

    "nb_execution_cache_path = \"path/to/mycache\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The path should point to an **empty folder**, or a folder where a **jupyter cache already exists**.\n",

    "Once you have run the documentation build, you can inspect the contents of the cache with the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",

    "## Executing in temporary folders\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the command working directory (cwd) that a notebook runs in will be the directory it is located in.\n",
    "However, you can set `nb_execution_in_temp=True` in your `conf.py`, to change this behaviour such that, for each execution, a temporary directory will be created and used as the cwd.\n",

    "The execution of notebooks is managed by {doc}`nbclient <nbclient:client>`.\n",

    "The `nb_execution_timeout` sphinx option defines the maximum time (in seconds) each notebook cell is allowed to run.\n",
    "If the execution takes longer an exception will be raised.\n",
    "The default is 30 s, so in cases of long-running cells you may want to specify an higher value.\n",
    "The timeout option can also be set to `None` or -1 to remove any restriction on execution time.\n",

    "This global value can also be overridden per notebook by adding this to you notebooks metadata:\n",
